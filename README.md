## Hi, $username$
My name is [**Nikita**](https://www.facebook.com/nik.kiselov) and its my personal website.Basically this is just a résumé.
This is done with the help of good old HTML, CSS, a little bit JS and, of course, love <sup>❤️</sup>.
It's hosted with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) and good [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) helps to organize things that go into `<body>`. And I'm also using [**HEAD**](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) for reference to build `<head>`
